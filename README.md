## ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project is an initial exploration of LangChain for building an interactive question-answering system.

- The system allows users to ask questions.
- It searches a vector database to find relevant information.
- The database is populated with chunks extracted from multiple PDF documents.
- When a user asks a question, the system finds and returns the most relevant PDF chunk(s) as the answer.

The goal is to efficiently retrieve information from large collections of PDFs using natural language queries.
